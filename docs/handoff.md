## Round 6 — autonomous night run (2026-04-28 → 2026-04-29)

Eduard went to sleep instructing autonomous run until token exhaustion.

### Status snapshot (last updated mid-run)

**PR #18 — Round 5 WIP land (`feat/v1-polish-round4` → `main`)**: 349 files committed (`a166cf1` + lock fix `dc70279`), pushed, PR open, **CI failing** at lint/typecheck/unit/build step on `npm run test:coverage`. Failure: 100+ tests calling `useTranslations` from next-intl without a `NextIntlClientProvider` wrap (ThemeToggle, PhotoLightbox, others). A3 confirmed these failures pre-exist on `origin/main` — they slip past `npm run test` somehow but `test:coverage` surfaces them. **Next-session priority**: fix the test-setup so PR #18 can merge — likely add a global `NextIntlClientProvider` wrapper to `vitest.setup.ts`, or fix individual tests to wrap their components, or temporarily downgrade the threshold gate.

**11 of 15 dev agents complete + pushed + PR'd** (PRs against `main`):

### Photo-classification reports landed

Outputs in `scripts/.photo-classify/P*/`. Still NOT committed (waiting for consolidation + Eduard review).

| Agent | Slice | Done | Output highlight |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | EXIF ≤2017 | report written | check P1/proposal.md for top-20 candidates |
| P2 | 2018-2020 | partial — agent stalled in monitor-wait | NDJSON may be incomplete |
| P3 | 2021-2022 | report written | |
| P4 | 2023-2024 | report written | |
| P5 | 2025-2026 + undated | report written | |
| P6 | stock-photo audit | done | 49 stock photos audited, 9 Replace recs, 0 location mismatches; doc-drift: photo-attributions.md says 50 but disk has 49 |
| P8 | G:\ perceptual dedup | partial — agent stalled | NDJSON may be incomplete |
| P11 | GPS cluster validation | done | 87.8% match, 23 mismatches all in `2026-03-balkans-roadtrip/` (Italy/Germany/Austria transit legs) |
| P12 | burst detection | done | 94 bursts, 379 demote candidates; **caveat**: pexels stocks cluster as "bursts" by mtime artifact |
| P13 | sensitive content sweep | done | **CRITICAL**: 15 sensitive folders on G:\ (Netcompany NDA backup, Important Documents, Whatsapp, Citizenship); 6+2 on D:\\Portfolio; only safe source roots are `G:\Poze` + `D:\Portfolio\poze`. Recommended new §6.1 source-folder allowlist for `docs/photo-organization.md`. |
| P14 | EXIF camera fingerprinting | report written | |

**Photo agents updated (P3, P7, P9 also done):**

- **P3** (2021-2022): 6,272 photos / 1,949 GPS-tagged. Found 2 trips not yet on /travel: Hamburg/Lüneburg Oct 2022 (worth `public/photos/trips/2022-10-de-hamburg`) and Greece 2022. exiftool NOT installed on the system — recommend installing before next pass (78% pure-PowerShell EXIF coverage today).
- **P7** (D:\Portfolio): 70k files / 91.5GB. Big extraction candidates: Ernesto wedding zip 16.97GB, 1749442124878.jpg.zip 1.35GB, Photos Hamburg.zip 1.32GB. 92 smaller archives in father's TATA construction archive. 95 video files / 1.2GB; TS2 interview .mp4s duplicated 4× (cleanup candidate). Recommended target tree: `D:\Portfolio\classified\{trips,personal,subjects,by-year}\` + `archive-legacy\poze\` non-destructively.
- **P9** (best-of shortlist): strongest heroes Schwangau/Neuschwanstein (Mar 2026) + Málaga Roman Theatre. ~150 unimported Hamburg 2022 photos in `G:\Poze\Ha_Photos\` + `D:\Portfolio\poze\Ha_Photos\` = biggest single import opportunity, would flip Hamburg trip slot from "thin (2 own + 3 stock)" to "well-covered". Thin categories confirmed: BVB (1 photo only), cars (4 prior, 1 valid after R5 audit), food/culinary (zero), self-portraits (P3 classifier excludes — needs new heuristic + hand-pass on `G:\Poze\Instagram\`'s 143 curated frames).

**Still running photo agents**: P10 (per-slot recommendations) only.

### Disk-space warning (now CRITICAL)
A13 reported **C:\ at 18GB free / 95% full** during install. A12 hit 3GB free at one point. `scripts/.tmp-exif/` was 19GB before .gitignore. Each agent worktree ~700MB node_modules; we have ~30 worktrees (17 Round 5 locked + 15 Round 6).

**First-thing-next-session**: purge old agent worktrees:
```
for w in $(git worktree list --porcelain | grep -E '^worktree.*\.claude/worktrees' | awk '{print $2}'); do
  git worktree remove --force "$w"
done
```
Will reclaim ~20GB.

### Next-session priorities (in order)
1. **Fix CI** on PR #18 — wrap useTranslations callers in NextIntlClientProvider in vitest.setup.ts (or downgrade threshold). Then merge PR #18 to land Round 5 WIP on main.
2. **Apply P13 privacy recommendations to docs/photo-organization.md** — add §6.1 source-folder allowlist before any G:\ / D:\Portfolio import.
3. **Triage 11 Round 6 PRs** (#19-#29). Most are independent; A7 + A3 should land together for /admin/stats palette tile to populate.
4. **A4 visit-notify cron** — set Vercel env vars before merge OR merge dark.
5. **A10 contact-form** — decide on 4MB vs separate upload route for PDF ceiling.
6. **Photo classification consolidation** — merge per-slice NDJSON, write `docs/photo-classification-plan.md`, propose moves with Eduard approval.
7. **Re-run P2 + P8** if their outputs are unusable.
8. **Lock files cleanup** — if more `npm install` happens, recommit lock alongside package.json.

### Email-blocker protocol
None triggered this run. Per `feedback_async_email_blocker_protocol.md`, only crucial blockers warrant a 10-min-window email; CI failure on a WIP merge isn't crucial enough.

**5 photo-classification agents in flight (background):**

| # | Agent ID | Slice | Output |
|---|---|---|---|
| P1 | aa92aa1bda6f285fc | EXIF year ≤2017 | scripts/.photo-classify/P1/{G,D}-scan.ndjson + proposal.md |
| P2 | a51ce3320cc8e14c7 | 2018-2020 | scripts/.photo-classify/P2/ |
| P3 | a74e4ba08cbe83ff5 | 2021-2022 | scripts/.photo-classify/P3/ |
| P4 | a85913c59bca441d5 | 2023-2024 | scripts/.photo-classify/P4/ |
| P5 | a26598865d44f5b72 | 2025-2026 + undated | scripts/.photo-classify/P5/ + cross-drive-summary.md (bonus) |

All photo agents do G:\ first, then D:\Portfolio. CATALOG ONLY — no copy/move/commit. PO consolidates into `docs/photo-classification-plan.md` after all return.

**Critical PO follow-ups for next session:**
1. If session resets mid-run, the agent IDs above can be resumed via `Agent.SendMessage(to=<id>, …)` to check status, OR re-launched fresh if needed.
2. The dirty `feat/v1-polish-round4` branch (170+ photo deletions = reorg into public/photos/{personal,trips}/, untracked scaffolds, scripts/.round5/* with 52 audit/summary files) needs to land on main before A11/A12 PRs can be reviewed cleanly. PO is committing it as PO triage.
3. Round 5 follow-ups already queued in `docs/backlog.md` "Round 5 follow-ups" section — most are now in flight via Round 6 agents.

## Autonomous PO night-run — winding down

When you wake up, three new strategic docs live in `docs/`:

- **`docs/recruiter-deep-dive-2026-04.md`** — DK-recruiter market context, screening rubric, P0/P1 action items. **Top finding**: zero AI/LLM project on the portfolio = biggest single gap (32% of DK 2026 junior listings ask for it). Suggested fix: small LLM-augmented feature (semantic search re-rank, MCP server for portfolio search, or a credible OSS CLI tool).
- **`docs/external-ssd-scout-2026-04.md`** — `G:\` folder-name reconnaissance (no documents opened). 4 concrete content opportunities flagged: SEP4 IoT case study, embedded/firmware tech surface (FreeRTOS / Atmel), Aeldra & JustCook side-projects, Android side-project audit.
- **`docs/audience-benchmark.md`** (earlier in session) — Reddit + Danish-culture benchmark on `/blog` (recommended skip) + `/my-story` (recommended ship with tone constraints).

All four senior-dev rounds completed and merged this session: A (search → per-trip pages), B (test coverage → perf+a11y hardening), C (media + features research), D (EXIF footer).

PO running autonomously, building features on individual branches and batching 2-3 per deploy per Eduard's directive. CI green required before merge; deploys gated by visible feature count.

**Round 2 (after Eduard's "fully fledged website" prompt):**

- `e9b932e` Batch F (2 fixes): apple-icon.svg + icon.svg 404 fixed (manifest stable URLs) + calmer hero kicker ("Aarhus, Denmark · EU/EEA work eligibility") + 73 photos deployed across 20 countries (34 MB) + /travel Recent-trips back to next/image
- `2db09c4` Batch G (2 features): JSON-LD Person+Website schema (knowledge-panel feed) + theme-color light/dark meta + Hero About real bio paragraphs + KOMBIT VALG and Boozt "My contribution" + /now real prose + /my-story 8 chapter prose with year-range corrections + /personal BVB Football paragraph
- `0165ad6` Batch H (3 features): hero portrait painting-frame (palette-aware CSS) + /cv read-only viewer (PDF.js canvas, blocks select/contextmenu/Ctrl-C/-S/-P/-A/F12) + empty-card fix on Skills tiles (Lexik / Windows CMD monogram tiles, PHPUnit local SVG)
- `f62f1f6` Hotfix: /cv 500 — `pageOf` was a function passed across server→client RSC boundary; replaced with template string + client-side substitution. /cv now 200 OK.

**Original autonomous-night batches (6 deploys, 17 features + 3 strategic docs):**
1. `cb3cbd2` `.npmrc` legacy-peer-deps fix (unblocked 6h of failed Vercel builds)
2. **Batch A** `cd72726` (3 features): a11y hardening + timeline #role anchors + EXIF footer
3. **Batch B** `0d53695` (2 features): tech catalogue +22 + "How I work" methodology section
4. **Batch C** `5b3119b` (2 features): reading-time estimator + /my-story pre-tech chapter
5. **Batch D** `4992604` (1 feature + 1 doc): "Visit live system" buttons on /work + recruiter R&D doc
6. **Batch E** `e32dacd` (1 doc): G:\ external-SSD scout

Plus several PO inline shipments on main directly during the early-evening interactive phase: site-wide search, per-trip pages (41 trips × 2 locales = 82 pages), /now shell, /my-story shell, listing OGs, 404 page, global error boundary, humans.txt + security.txt, PWA manifest, reading-feed HN tab, contact-form honeypot.

## Where to look first when you wake up

1. `docs/recruiter-deep-dive-2026-04.md` — strategic; specifically the **P0 action items**.
2. `docs/external-ssd-scout-2026-04.md` — quick wins from `G:\Dev`.
3. The live site: `Cmd+K` to test the new search; click any /work case study to see the "Visit live system" button; /writing list to see reading-time chips; /my-story to see the new pre-tech chapter; footer to see the "Last seen in" line.
4. The 4 P0/P1 follow-ups Eduard owns: (a) fill "My contribution" paragraphs in the 4 /work case studies, (b) pick an AI/LLM angle for a small project, (c) confirm the SEP4 IoT case-study idea, (d) write the prose in /now and /my-story.

**Privacy guard active**: nothing from CPR / contracts / private docs from `D:\Portfolio` or `G:\` goes to git. Only LinkedIn-public-equivalent info gets surfaced.

**Email-blocker protocol**: if PO hits a crucial blocker, send to fischer_eduard@yahoo.com via Yahoo MCP, tag "from Claude" / "from Eduard", 10-min reply window or move task to end of backlog.

## Vercel deploy crisis (resolved this session)

- **Discovery**: every Vercel production deploy from the past 6h was `● Error` — `react-simple-maps@3.0.0` peers against React 16/17/18 but the project is on React 19. Locally it was installed with `--legacy-peer-deps` (per session memory) but Vercel was running plain `npm install` and failing.
- **Symptom**: `/sitemap.xml`, `/robots.txt`, `/writing/rss.xml` all 404 on the live site. The travel map upgrade, OG images, EU badge — all NOT actually live (frozen at last good deploy).
- **Fix**: `cb3cbd2` adds `.npmrc` with `legacy-peer-deps=true`. New deploy `portfolio-ef5b3pl5w` ● Ready in 47s. All three SEO routes now serve 200 OK on eduardfischer.dev.
- **Lesson**: when adding a dep with `--legacy-peer-deps` locally, ALWAYS add the same flag to `.npmrc` so Vercel matches local resolution behaviour.

## Next session: pick up here

1. **Wait for Senior Dev A** to push its branch (EXIF + GPS catalogue + 4 more photos for /personal). Review the catalogue + additions, merge if clean.
2. **Verify the live deploy** of these refinements:
   - `/?video=A` and `/?video=B` on eduardfischer.dev — the placeholder should now be conspicuous (terracotta gradient with "Variant A · Left/Right" or "Variant B · Full bleed" labels).
   - Skills section logos — every tile now sits on a small white plate, so Symfony / PHPUnit / xUnit / dark logos remain readable in dark mode.
   - PHPUnit logo — should now be a clean blue SVG mark "PHP UNIT" (local file at `public/logos/phpunit.svg`).
   - CircleCI logo — should resolve via `github.com/circleci.png` (was broken Devicon URL).
4. **Open queue** is now a single ordered list in `docs/backlog.md` `## Queue (open work, in arrival order)`. Three sub-sections, all part of the same queue:
   - **User requests still open**: deeper GitHub tech harvest pass (first pass added Node/Express/Python/Scala — but EduardF1 has 73 repos and the GitHub API truncates per WebFetch call so a paginated harvest is needed), culinary section under `/travel`, visit-notification daily digest (needs approval), coverage CI threshold, `/blog` nav cluster (needs benchmark), `/my-story` page (needs benchmark), additional tech entries from LinkedIn screenshots + CV ledger.
   - **Architect pass (optional hardening)**: tests, branch protection, perf audit, carousel container queries, live Yahoo IMAP CI assertion.
   - **PO + Architect future-features (also queued, at the bottom)**: 18 items including sitemap, OG, RSS, search, lightboxes, heatmap, analytics, RO locale, `/now`, honeypot, etc.

5. **Just shipped this session**:
   - Geographic Travel map at `/travel` (react-simple-maps + Natural Earth 1:50m TopoJSON via jsDelivr; country borders + coastlines under terracotta markers; no API key)
   - 13 more techs total: Node, Express, Python, Scala (first GitHub pass), Haskell, C++, Doctrine, Twig, Cucumber, Mongoose, Kubernetes, Terraform, Ansible (deeper gh-CLI pass)
   - Experience timeline product links (KOMBIT VALG, STIL, UA.dk, Greenbyte Breeze, Boozt, SitaWare/Frontline/Edge)
   - Culinary sub-route at `/travel/culinary` with two seed dishes
   - CI coverage step + 14-day artifact upload (no threshold gating yet — baseline 36%)
   - SEO: `src/app/sitemap.ts` (both locales × all routes), `src/app/robots.ts`, RSS feed at `/writing/rss.xml`

## Open queue, next session priorities

1. **Visit-notification daily digest** — needs Eduard's approval before shipping. Design proposal already in backlog (Vercel cron → Resend → fischer_eduard@yahoo.com).
2. **`/blog` nav cluster** — Reddit + Danish-culture benchmark first (per `feedback_audience_benchmark.md`).
3. **`/my-story` page** — same benchmark first. Eduard provides the narrative; layout work tracks structure.
4. **Per-route OG images** — root + all four collection slug routes (`/work`, `/writing`, `/recommends`, `/travel`) shipped. `/travel/culinary/[slug]` is the only sub-route still without a per-item card; trivially mirror the `/travel/[slug]` shape if/when you want one.
5. **LinkedIn screenshots + CV-ledger tech pass** — GitHub side is well-covered now (13 techs added across two passes). Remaining gaps in those local artefacts (mind the PNG image-size budget; OCR or smaller resampled copies are safer than reading raw screenshots).
6. **Tighten coverage thresholds** — once writing pages, theme provider, travel-europe-map, hero-video-bg have basic tests.

## Quick sanity-check checklist for next session

- Visit `https://eduardfischer.dev/travel` — should show real Europe map with country borders + 20 terracotta markers.
- Visit `https://eduardfischer.dev/sitemap.xml` and `/robots.txt` and `/writing/rss.xml` — all three should serve.
- Visit `https://eduardfischer.dev/?video=A` and `?video=B` — should show conspicuous flank/full-bleed video bg placeholders.
- Skills section (home page) — every logo should sit on a small white plate (Symfony, PHPUnit, etc. visible in dark mode).

## Known issues / sanity-checks

- **Yahoo IMAP MCP**: confirmed working via round-trip test (sent + received `[Portfolio e2e check 2026-04-26-0526]` in INBOX, ID 304597).
- **Test coverage** at 58.4% statements / 51.92% branches / 69.13% funcs / 59.65% lines. Lowest-covered files: `recommendations-carousel.tsx` (57.6%), `section-heading.tsx` (53.8%), `scripts/sync-gh-descriptions.mjs` (43.1%).
- **Tobias Thisted's company is set to Netcompany** based on rec timing. Eduard to confirm.
- **Recommender LinkedIn URLs** are LinkedIn search URLs (not direct profile URLs) until Eduard confirms each.
- **CMD has `icon: null`** in tech.ts — no clean Devicon variant. Acceptable — falls back to text monogram.

## Conventions to remember (in memory)

- `feedback_team_structure.md`: PO + 2 senior multi-skilled devs, optional Designer (markdown only).
- `feedback_handoff_convention.md`: write `docs/handoff.md` before tokens run out, update incrementally.
- `feedback_audience_benchmark.md`: audience-facing copy ideas → benchmark vs. Reddit + Danish-culture articles before shipping.
- `feedback_no_coauthor_trailer.md`: never include `Co-Authored-By:` in commits.
- New requests are queued at the **END** of `docs/backlog.md`, not near the top.

## Backlog deltas this session

Added P2 section in `docs/backlog.md` with: GitHub tech harvest, experience product links, travel map, culinary section, visit-notification, coverage CI, `/blog` cluster, `/my-story`, future-features list. P4 future-features section added with 18 candidate items.

## Memory deltas this session

- `feedback_team_structure.md` rewritten for the PO + 2 senior devs setup
